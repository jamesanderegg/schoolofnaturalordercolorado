He became a forest ranger in Idaho and said that it was there, in 1907, that he began to seriously undertake his self development with the study and practice of Eastern philosophy.

The School moved to various locations, and during the '30s established in Colorado. It was near the mountain town of Bailey that the School built a retreat called the Ashrama from which Vitvan would leave during the winter to travel and lecture, and return to in the summer to teach seminars and classes."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"During this period of his life, Vitvan was growing increasingly dissatisfied with the presentation of the Wisdom Teachings in the older metaphysical, occult and mystical framework that he felt did not fit the emerging consciousness of the new cycle now dawning.

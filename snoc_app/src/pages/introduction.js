        <p>
          When one is invited upon a journey, it is fair to indicate the route
          that is to be traveled, and the equipment that will be required. To do
          this about the work and meaning of the School of the Natural Order is
          not a simple matter; for to state in a few descriptive words the
          principles for which the School stands and the comprehensiveness of
          the levels of work, seems impossible. Nevertheless, that attempt must
          be made in order that an answer may be given to the many questions
          that are constantly being asked. In presenting this information, no
          attempt will be made to fortify statements with substantial proof or
          verifications. Adequate information is given in the body of literature
          of the S.N.O

          Do you know that the most important, fundamental, basic fact about
          yourself is the Power to be Conscious? With what power do you imagine?
          With what power do you conceive? With what power do you formulate the
          neural responses of stimuli received or registered into images,
          pictures, etc.? With what power do you give values, meanings, and
          react thereto, etc.? Call that Power as you wish, label it as you
          like…with what power do you reflect, ruminate, contemplate, etc.? For
          the sake of communication, we refer to That…by whatever name you call
          it…as the Power to be Conscious.
        </p>

          The effort in the School of the Natural Order is to get acquainted
          with ourselves, develop ourselves, lay hold of that mighty dynamic
          power with which we function, and direct that power. Vitvan

        <h3>Ancient Gnosis</h3>
        <p>
          The Ancient Wisdom Teachings present a description of the journey to
          be taken to self-knowledge. These teachings have been given in various
          ways: Vedas, Upanishads, the Kabala, the Greek and Egyptian Mysteries,
          etc. “When we think of the schools for attainment in the Orient,
          India, etc., we must not neglect dating them…as they were great in
          their respective times. Scientists of the Occident, however, have so
          far surpassed the methods of attainment of the Orient, that the
          schools of attainment of the future will be in the USA, and relative
          to our times, will be far in advance of any that the Orient produced.
          For the clearest, highest, etc. methods of spiritual attainment, look
          for the new developing schools in the USA. SNO is outstanding among
          them.” (Vitvan)
        </p>
        <h3>Science</h3>
        <p>
          Students must have enough of the scientific approach to properly
          understand the Wisdom Teachings and to interpret them and represent
          them TODAY. Modern physicists have confirmed that we live in a dynamic
          energy world. In a measure at least, we try to realize that the
          dynamic and creative pattern of each field is proceeding in its own
          course, on its own level, and in response to the dynamic operations of
          frequencies.
        </p>
        <h3>Semantic</h3>
        <p>
          SNO students have been given a methodology. We learn that we form
          images from the dynamic operation of frequencies and choose values to
          give to them. We study and use the tools of general semantics to
          develop clearer and more exact thinking. As our thinking and
          understanding becomes more precise, and as we learn to consciously
          abstract, we develop conscious control of our forces, and as Vitvan
          stated. “we elect what we want to be, what we want to do…."
        </p>
        <p>
          “To assist the student to understand himself, to recognize his own
          natural order stages or states, to instruct and prepare him for the
          steps ahead, so he will be enabled to take these steps intelligently
          and wisely with a minimum of confusion and bewilderment and a maximum
          of insight and cooperation with the process – represents the purpose
          of this work and this teaching.” (Vitvan)
